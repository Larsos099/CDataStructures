# CDataStructures

## What is CDataStructures?
**CDataStructures** is a lightweight header-only pack that implements multiple fundamental data structures in **C98/99**, designed to be simple, efficient, and **C++ interoperable**.

---

## Included Data Structures
Currently, CDataStructures implements:

- **Singly Linked List** (`sl_*`)
- **Doubly Linked List** (`dl_*`)
- **Circularly Linked List** (`cl_*`)

---

## Planned Data Structures
Future updates aim to include:

- All variants of Queues (e.g., FIFO, Priority Queue, Circular Queue)

---

## How to Use CDataStructures
All examples are provided in the [`examples/`](./examples/) folder.

For instance, if you want to use a Doubly Linked List:

`examples/double_linked_list.c`

There you'll find an example of how to use the double linked list

## Header File Listing

[`linkedlist.h`](./linkedlist.h) → Singly Linked List

[`doublelinkedlist.h`](./doublelinkedlist.h) → Double Linked List

[`circularlinkedlist.h`](./circularlinkedlist.h) → Circular Linked List
